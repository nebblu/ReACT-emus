# ReACT-emus
Repository for emulators of the cosmological matter power spectrum boost

## Data pipelines 

This directory contains the pipeline to produce the boost data using a combination of codes:

1.  [ReACT](https://github.com/nebblu/ACTio-ReACTio)
2.  [HMcode2020](https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode)
3.  [MGCAMB](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCAMB)


## Emulator pipelines

This directory contains the pipeline to train and test the boost emulator. This employs the  [CosmoPower](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower) platform. 

## Emulators 

This directory contains the pre-trained emulators for various cosmological and gravitational models.
